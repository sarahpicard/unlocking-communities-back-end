## About the Application 🤔

### The Problem 
Unlocking Communities, a non-profit that facilitates the sale and distribution of vital water filtration systems and clean-burning stoves in under-developed regions of the world was searching for a streamlined and easy to use application for inventory management and sales contract digitization. 

The organization currently utilizes an expensive licensed software, which is un-sustainable for their business structure. In order to divert more resources to their core mission, replacing the current enterprise software with a proprietary application is vital. 

### The Solution 
The application created is a mobile-first React app, built to be used on Android tablets currently owned by the organization. The application is made to support the needs of local community managers in underdeveloped regions, such as their warehouses in Haiti 🇭🇹 

Local community leaders and warehouse managers can log into the application from their tablets, view the inventory they currently have in stock, for both water-filtration systems and clean-burning stoves, as well as enter important contract information which has previously been obtained via paper contract by a community entrepreneur. Allowing for digital inventory management and digitization of paper contracts is important for community warehouse flow and advancement of the organization's mission. 

This application is part of a decoupled full stack app. The front-end repository can be found [here](https://github.com/sarahpicard/unlocking-communities-front-end)
